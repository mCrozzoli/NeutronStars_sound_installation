# NeutronStars_sound_installation
a sound installation on Radio Pulsars, using scientific data sets, supercollider, and midi controllers

Inspired by the scientific sonifications from Jodrell Bank Observatory, Radio Pulsars was created as an etude, to study the interactive potential playfulness of scientific sounds through MIDI controllers.

In this piece, I coded sounds mimicking the aesthetic quality of already made pulsarsâ€™ sonifications from the Jodrell Bank Observatory. I used data sets from the European Pulsar Timing Array. I also programmed MIDI controllers to start and stop these sounds, and change the speed ratio at which the data is being read, which creates diverse and surprising sound artifacts.

In the installation, two MIDI controllers are positioned in front of each other.  The participants enter the room, and by pressing buttons on the controllers, they play the sound of the stars.

As a sounding result, complex and surprising textures and sonic movements are created, capturing the attention of the participants in a playful interactive environment.
